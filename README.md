# Gender & Diplomacy - Data Analaysis Project


## Overview
This project explores gender representation and patterns in international diplomacy using real-world datasets.  
I worked on cleaning, restructuring and analyzing the data, then built a full presentation to explain the findings visually.

## Files & Structure
**dataset/**  
Contains the original dataset and the codebook used to understand and structure the variables.

**scripts/**  
Includes SQL queries, data cleaning steps, and the notebook used during the analysis.

**presentation/**  
Full PDF presentation with graphics, insights and final conclusions.

## Tools
- SQL (PostgreSQL)   
- Excel (cleaning, first exploration)  
- Canva (final visual presentation)

## What I Did
- Structured and cleaned the raw dataset  
- Mapped variables using the codebook  
- Explored patterns by gender and diplomatic roles  
- Ran SQL queries for deeper insights  
- Created visuals and a full presentation

## Key Insights
- Gender distribution across diplomatic roles shows notable imbalance  
- Certain regions show more representation than others  
- Interesting patterns emerge when combining role type + gender + region  

## Goal
Make the data easier to understand, highlight meaningful patterns and communicate the results clearly.
